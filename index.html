                I have just over completed my Undergraduate in IT from Victorian Institute
                 of Technology, Sydney, Australia. During my study, I acquired knowledge about
                 many programming languages and worked on various school's projects.

            <p  id="about" style="float: right; width: 45%; padding-right: 10%; font-size: 30px; font-family: fantasy; font-weight: bold;">
            As a teenager in school, I was the kid other students approached about issues 
            with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing or resolving
            any technical problems. Today, not much has changed. I'm still the first 
            point of call for technical issues. The difference is I now can also develop
            applications and work on myself about the vast world of computer technology.
